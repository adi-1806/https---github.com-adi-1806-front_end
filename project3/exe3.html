                <p>  
                    Town Hall has the answer. For only $100, you can get a book of tickets for all of the remaining
                    speakers. And the bargain includes a second book of tickets for a companion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Or, for $50, you can give yourself the gift of our speakers, and still get an extra ticket for a
                    companion, but for just one of the events.

                </p>
